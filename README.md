# Immersive Exploration

The intend of Immersive Exploration is to let the user design the space by producing the unique form. 
The user inserts the parameters such as unit size, quantity of forms to be subtracted, and how many 
levels are desired. In the end, the user results with the system of units stacked on top of each other,
with the inner and outer design of walls and openings based on the subtraction of basic shapes such 
as boxes, cones, spheres, and toruses. Component parts of different units are interchangeable and can be 
stacked in a variety of ways if there are any new needs or constraints arising in the future.
